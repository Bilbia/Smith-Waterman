# Smith-Waterman
Smith-Waterman algorithm that finds a partially matching substring in a longer string. 

In order to run the program, first run seqGenerator.py, in order to generate a file containing two randomized sequences. This file will be the input of the main program. The file will be named dna.seq. 

Compile the program through the command g++ -o main main.cpp. Then, run the program with the command ./main < dna.seq. The results will be outputed to the file output.txt.

# Local Search
The local-search algorithm seeks to find a higher score matching substrig in another string through randomness. Every time the program is run, it will select a subsequence of the first string, with random size K and random index I, and it will then select P equally random subsequences of the second string, all of the same size K, and will compare the subsequences of the second string with the one from the first string. It will then return the highest scoring one. 

In order to run the program, make sure to have an input file, which can also be generated by running the seqGenerator.py file.

Complie the program through the command g++ -o local busca-local.cpp. Then, run the program with the command ./local < dna.seq. The results will be outputed to the file outputLocal.txt.
