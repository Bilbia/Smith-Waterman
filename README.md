# Smith-Waterman
Smith-Waterman algorithm that finds a partially matching substring in a longer string. 

In order to run the program, first run seqGenerator.py, in order to generate a file containing two randomized sequences. This file will be the input of the main program. The file will be named dna.seq. 

Compile the program through the command g++ -o main main.cpp. Then, run the program with the command ./main < dna.seq. The results will be outputed to the file output.txt.
